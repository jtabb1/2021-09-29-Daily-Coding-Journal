    <p> Today I got closer to MVP but ran into a bug.</p>

    <p> 
      A personal and business emergencey prevented me from 
      posting this on 9/29/2021 in the afternoon, but that's why I should've posted it in the a.m.  I spent 
      the rest of the day after about 3:30 p.m. dealing with 
      it.
